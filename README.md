# WSE
These three projects are copied from https://github.com/JerryMXB. These are learning notes.

## Introduction

This projects consist of three parts.

### [Index](https://github.com/JerryMXB/WSE_Indexing)

In this part, we use the public data (which is independent to the whole project) to build an inverted index.

The detail of the algorithm is shown in the blog [Build an Inverted Index Using Java](http://www.chaoqunhuang.com/blog/build-inverted-index-in-java.html).

### [Crawler](https://github.com/JerryMXB/WSE_Crawler)

Use google api to get a couple of pages.

The target of this part is to get the data to build an inverted index for this project.

### [Query](https://github.com/JerryMXB/WSE_Query)

Since we get the inverted index of crawled data from previous two parts, we can use this project to do the query the result.
